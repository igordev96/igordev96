# Hey, everyone. I'm Igor! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
As a Front-end Developer with a focus on React, I have experience building web applications using modern Front-end frameworks and libraries. 
I am passionate about creating dynamic user interfaces and leveraging the latest technologies to deliver engaging user experiences. 
Recently, I have been studying React Native and exploring how to build native mobile applications using this framework. 
Additionally, I have a strong background in TypeScript, which has helped me to write more maintainable and scalable code. With a keen eye for design and a commitment to quality, I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and contribute to the development community.
