# Hey, everyone. I'm Igor! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
As a Software Developer, I specialize in developing web application. My expertise revolves around technologies such as React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, NextJS, SASS...

In addition to my professional work, I'm passionate about full-stack web development and UI/UX design. I'm actively engaged in a personal project, where I'm developing a Progressive Web Application (PWA) using Next.js for the front-end and Figma for design. The goal of this project is to provide users with an efficient tool to manage their meals and generate shopping lists for required ingredients.

My commitment to staying up-to-date with modern web development trends and my dedication to expanding my skill set are key driving forces behind my work.

Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate and innovate in the world of web development!
